# Pomodoro Clock

A simple pomodoro clock written in React, styled with [Pure css](https://purecss.io/), and animated with [react-circular-progressbar](https://github.com/iqnivek/react-circular-progressbar).

It doesn't pause. I wrote it for myself as a tool to help me commit to working for a period of time, and being able to pause is contrary to that goal.
